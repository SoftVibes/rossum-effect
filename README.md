# The Rossum Effect

## What is it?
A CSS overlay transition

## Why the "Rossum" effect? Has it got anything to do with Python?
Because I was using Guido Von Rossum's name and face as the primary content while creating this. Has got nothign to with Python directly, do love coding in Python though. Thanks to https://github.com/Shuvam586 for suggesting Rossum, the name fits.

## Why put it on the Github profile?
I know it isn't a big deal, but it is one of the few decent pieces of CSS code I have ever written without any help from Stackoverflow.

## Is it that good?
Yes
