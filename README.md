# The Rossum Effect

## What is it?
A CSS overlay transition

## Why the "Rossum" effect? Has it got anything to do with Python?
Because I was using Guido Von Rossum's name and face as the primary content while creating this. Has got nothing to with Python directly, do love coding in Python though. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Shuvam586">@Shuvam586</a> for suggesting the idea of using Rossum, the name fits.

## Why put it on the Github profile?
I know it isn't a big deal, but it is one of the few decent pieces of CSS code I have ever written without any help from StackOverflow.

## Is it that good?
Yes
